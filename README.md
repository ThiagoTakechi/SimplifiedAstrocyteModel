# Simplified Astrocyte Model

This repository contains the code for the simulation of the simplified astrocyte compartmental model by Bezerra & Roque, Dopamine facilitates the response to glutamatergic inputs in astrocyte cell models. PLOS Computational Biology. 2023 (DOI:).

The main code is divided into three files: SimplifiedAstrocyteModel.py, with model equations and methods to run the simulations, SimplifiedAstrocyteParameters.py, with model parameters, and SimplifiedAstrocyteSupport.py, with support methods to simulate the model. The Juyter notebook reproduces the figures S4 and 4 of the paper.
